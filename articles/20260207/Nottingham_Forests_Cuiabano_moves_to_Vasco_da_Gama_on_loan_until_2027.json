  "content": "Nottingham Forest defender Cuiabano has moved back to Brazil on loan with Vasco da Gama until the end of the calendar year.\n\nThe deal has includes a similar fee to the £10million Forest paid for him in the summer and the Serie A side have an option to make the transfer permanent.\n\nCuiabano, 22, was one of four players to sign for Forest from Botafogo over the summer, along with goalkeeper John Victor, striker Igor Jesus and central defender Jair Cunha.\n\nBut while the other trio have all had first team opportunities at Forest — with Jesus in particular establishing himself as a key figure — Cuiabano is set to depart without playing a first-team game.\n\nThe full back or winger initially remained at Botafogo on loan, but has been training with the Forest squad in recent weeks and played in a B team game against Paris Saint-Germain last month.\n\nBut, with Forest having signed German left back Luca Netz from Borussia Monchengladbach earlier in the week, for a fee of £1.1million, Cuiabano would have dropped down the pecking order at the City Ground.\n\nAnd the player, who signed in September, will now head back to his homeland to join Vasco who are yet to win this season after two games.",
