Check out the fancy all-caps dateline below. It means I’m a serious journalist on the ground in the Bay Area for the Super Bowl. Coming up:\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — We have larger NBA news to get to, but I wanted to highlight the fact that I am in the Bay Area for what brands call the Big Game this week. Two quick observations you won’t find anywhere else:\n\nI made the next one. You’ll just have to believe me.\n\nOK, let’s go to the trade board:\n\nTrade deadlines in professional sports have conditioned us to believe everything will happen on deadline day. Teams want to gather as much leverage as possible to win negotiations. But sometimes, these deals can operate on a timetable of their own. We saw this in yesterday’s flood of NBA transactions.\n\nA few highlights before we get perspective:\n\nIt was a lot, unexpectedly. I asked The Bounce’s Zach Harper what stood out to him most:\n\n“I’m interested in what Cleveland thinks it’s doing. It started with the De’Andre Hunter trade to Sacramento, but this Harden-for-Garland deal goes deeper into how little this organization believes in this core. The first- and second-apron luxury tax thresholds are designed to make you prove you believe in your roster. The Cavs did a few months ago. Now they don’t. And now they are saving money in a way that may show they don’t think they can convince Mitchell to stay when it’s time for his next extension (summer of 2027). They were the other talk of the league last season, and now they’re bailing.”\n\nSounds stressful. We’ll have more on the actual deadline in the next two days. And there are still big names on the board.\n\nKraft also not selected for HOF\nA week after news broke of former Patriots coach Bill Belichick being denied entry into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, a source confirmed to The Athletic yesterday that Patriots owner Bob Kraft also missed the necessary votes to get in. Both warrant a bust in Canton, whenever that happens, but this has been a complete mess, from the pettiness we talked about last week to the enhanced focus on a new, convoluted voting process. Read more.\n\nVonn tore ACL\nIn a brutal twist, Lindsey Vonn — one of the best skiers we’ve ever seen, attempting an Olympic comeback at 41 — tore her ACL in a World Cup race Friday, a week before the official comeback began. Despite the news, she’s holding hope that she can bear the pain and still compete, though that remains to be seen. See our full update here.\n\n📰 Find more news here 24/7.\n\n📺 Olympics: Alpine Skiing\n5:30 a.m. ET on Peacock\nThe opening ceremony isn’t until Friday, and this is only a training session, but it’s our first televised event of these Olympic Games. The rest of the day’s programming features curling. See the schedule here. We made it.\n\n📺 Soccer: Newcastle at Manchester City\n3 p.m. ET on Paramount+\nThis is the second leg of the Carabao Cup semifinal, and City leads 2-0 on aggregate. If you’re around a TV during the day, throw it on.\n\n📺 NBA: Nuggets at Knicks\n7 p.m. ET on ESPN\nAll is not lost in New York despite earlier reports. The Knicks have won six straight and sit second in the East at 32-18. As our Power Rankings also noted, the Nuggets are fully back thanks to Nikola Jokić’s return from injury. This is a good game, and Thunder-Spurs follows directly after.\n\nGet tickets to games like this here.\n\nBeware those afraid of heights: We have tales from the scariest catwalk in the NHL and maybe pro sports overall — Calgary. This was equal parts riveting and terrifying. What a read.\n\nVery serious and important: What color is the Gatorade bath going to be at Sunday’s Super Bowl?\n\nDavid Betancourt has a fun look at the creative process behind these new comic book-themed sports cards. Pretty cool.\n\nHeartwarming: At the Olympics, Team USA and Norway are partners in success.\n\nAndrew Marchand profiled NBC’s Molly Solomon, who could be considered one of the greatest sports TV execs of all time.\n\nMost-clicked in the newsletter yesterday: The Bad Bunny NFL anonymous player poll.\n\nMost-read on the website yesterday: NBA trade deadline live blog.\n\n📫 That’s all for now!
