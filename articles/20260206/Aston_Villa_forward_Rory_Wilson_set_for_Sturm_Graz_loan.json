  "content": "Aston Villa forward Rory Wilson is set to join Sturm Graz on a straight loan for the remainder of the season.\n\nThe Athletic previously reported that Wilson was likely to leave Villa in the winter transfer window, with several European clubs interested. This included teams in Scandinavia and enquiries from sides in the English Football League.\n\nHoffenheim, however, made an approach earlier this week, offering a six month loan, with a €7million option to buy at the end of the season. The 20-year-old is keen for senior minutes, having been firmly down in the striker pecking order for Villa manager Unai Emery, but couldn’t agree terms with the Bundesliga club owing to concerns whether he would earn first-team game time.\n\nSome leagues in Europe are still able to bring players in, with Sturm Graz now expected to complete the deal. They are third in the Austrian Bundesliga, four points off leaders RB Salzburg.\n\nWilson signed a new two-year deal with Villa in April 2025, with the option of a further 12 months.\n\nThe Scot joined Villa from Rangers’ academy in 2022, and has represented his country at Under-21 level.",
