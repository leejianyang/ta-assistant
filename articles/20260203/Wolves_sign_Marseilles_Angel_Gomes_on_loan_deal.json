  "content": "Wolverhampton Wanderers have signed Angel Gomes from Marseille on a loan deal with an option to buy.\n\nThe former Manchester United academy midfielder made 134 first-team appearances for Lille across four seasons before joining Marseille as a free agent last summer.\n\nDespite making 20 appearances across all competitions this season, Gomes did not start a Ligue 1 match since November and was not named from the start in any of Roberto De Zerbi’s side’s eight Champions League matches.\n\n“He’s young, but he’s experienced now, he’s got a lot of games behind him,” Wolves coach Rob Edwards said.\n\n“Everything that he brings, his intensity, his energy, his enthusiasm for football, we want him to bring all of that.\n\n“He’s got bags of quality, so I’m looking forward to seeing him integrate into the group.”\n\nEdwards’ side are at the foot of the Premier League with just one victory in 24 league matches this term.\n\nAll four of the 25-year-old’s international appearances for England came under interim head coach Lee Carsley in 2024.\n\nGomes made his first-team United debut in May 2017 at the age of 16 years and 263 days, making him the youngest player to represent the club since Duncan Edwards in 1953.\n\nAfter making 10 first-team appearances at Old Trafford, he joined Lille in 2020 and spent the 2020-2021 campaign on loan at Boavista in Portugal.\n\nMarseille are currently third in Ligue 1, seven points behind league leaders Lens. De Zerbi’s side were eliminated from the Champions League last week after failing to finish in the top 24 of the league phase.",
