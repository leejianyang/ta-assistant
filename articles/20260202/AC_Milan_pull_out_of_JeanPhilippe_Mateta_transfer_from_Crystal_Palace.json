  "content": "AC Milan have pulled out of a move for Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta.\n\nThe Athletic reported earlier on Monday that Mateta was was set to undergo further medical tests in London after the two sides agreed a deal worth more than €30million (£26m; $35.6m) for the forward the day before.\n\nThose medical checks have prompted the Serie A side to walk away from the deal with other clubs now expressing interest in a possible loan for the 28-year-old before Monday night’s deadline.\n\nMateta has been carrying a knee problem, with Palace opting to leave him out of their FA Cup third-round loss against Macclesfield, played on a 3G surface, because of issues with the joint.\n\nMateta’s failed departure will not have an impact on Jorgen Strand Larsen’s arrival, with the Norway international’s proposed £43million plus £5m move still on as things stand.\n\nMateta has made 34 appearances for Palace this season, scoring 10 goals in all competitions. He was not included in Palace’s squad for their 1-1 draw with Nottingham Forest on Sunday, with manager Oliver Glasner saying on Friday that he was “not in the right place to play” but that it was “nothing to do with a transfer”.\n\nThe striker has been unsettled at Palace for some time, with contract negotiations ongoing since before summer 2024 to extend his deal, which had entered its final 18 months.\n\nMateta joined Palace from German club Mainz in 2022 and has appeared 186 times for the club, recording 56 goals and 13 assists, and helped the side win the FA Cup last season.",
