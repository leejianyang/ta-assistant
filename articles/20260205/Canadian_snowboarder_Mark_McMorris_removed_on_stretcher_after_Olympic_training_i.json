  "content": "Canadian snowboarder Mark McMorris was removed on a stretcher after crashing during big air training in Livigno, Italy, on Wednesday night at the Milan Cortina Olympics.\n\nMcMorris was hurt as he was tuning up for Thursday’s qualifying event.\n\nIn a statement on their website, the Canadian Olympic Committee said, “Snowboarder Mark McMorris had a heavy crash this evening during big air training. Canadian Olympic Committee and Canada Snowboard staff are attending to him. We will provide more information as it becomes available.”\n\nMcMorris, 32, won bronze medals in the slopestyle competition in each of his previous three Winter Olympics — 2014, 2018 and 2022. He has won a record 25 medals in Winter X Games competitions.\n\nBig air courses are inherently dangerous, with athletes doing mid-air moves at high speed and high altitude. The course in Livigno is comprised of a ramp that is 165 feet tall and constructed on scaffolding.\n\nMcMorris is no stranger to serious injury. He ran into a tree during a backcountry ride in 2017 and suffered life-threatening injuries. He has had several surgeries, including the addition of a rod in his leg, a plate in his arm and a plate in his jaw.\n\nOn the flip side, McMorris’ ability to push the limits led him to become the first person to do a backside triple cork 1440 in the 2012 X Games and a double cork off a rail in 2018.",
