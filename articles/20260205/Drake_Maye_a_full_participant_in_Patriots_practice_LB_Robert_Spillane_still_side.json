  "content": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. — For the first time since suffering an injury to his throwing shoulder in the AFC Championship Game, New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye was listed as a full participant in practice on Wednesday.\n\nMaye has insisted all week in interviews that his shoulder feels fine, but worry was ramped up last Friday when Maye did not participate in the team’s final practice before flying to California.\n\n“It feels good,” Maye said of his shoulder on Wednesday morning before the team’s afternoon practice at Stanford University.\n\nThe Patriots have two practices — on Thursday and Friday — remaining before the Super Bowl.\n\nMaye’s status was the good news for New England. The bad news was that leading tackler Robert Spillane did not participate in the practice due to an ankle injury. Spillane said Wednesday morning that he’s confident he’ll play in the Super Bowl, but it’s still noteworthy that the linebacker did not take part in practice.\n\nHarold Landry, who led the Patriots with 8.5 sacks in the regular season, was a limited participant on Wednesday due to a knee injury that has lingered for over a month.\n\nBut Maye was the big concern. After insisting he would be fine for the Super Bowl, it was a good sign for the Patriots that he was back to being a full go in practice.",
