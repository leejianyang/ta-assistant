  "content": "Olympic champion Imane Khelif has said she is willing to undergo sex testing in order to return to boxing ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games.\n\nKhelif, 26, did not compete in boxing’s World Championships in September after World Boxing introduced mandatory sex testing a month earlier to determine eligibility for the men’s or women’s categories of competition and provide a “fair and level playing field.”\n\nThe Algerian had come under scrutiny after the International Boxing Association banned her and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting from the 2023 World Championships and said she had failed a test, showing that she had “competitive advantages over other female competitors.” Khelif was assigned female at birth and identifies on official documents as female.\n\nThe 2024 Olympic gold medallist filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against World Boxing’s decision but a hearing on that case is still pending. On Thursday, Khelif told CNN she had the “highest confidence in the Olympic committee” when it comes to gender eligibility in sport.\n\n“Of course, I would accept doing anything I’m required to do to participate in competitions,” she said when asked about her participation in the LA28 Games. “They should protect women, but they need to pay attention that while protecting women, they shouldn’t  hurt other women.”\n\nAhead of Paris 2024, the International Olympic Committee invalidated the IBA’s authority to run boxing at the Olympics, with Khelif and Lin able to compete. World Boxing was set up last year and granted provisional recognition to run the sport at future Games.\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump said in August that “the U.S. will not let men steal trophies from women at the 2028 Olympics.”\n\n“There will be a very, very strong form of testing,” he added. “And if the test doesn’t come out appropriately, they won’t be in the Olympics.”\n\nKhelif said that the report leading to her ban was “modified” and posted by people with “animosity” towards her, while clarifying that she has naturally high testosterone levels but she lowered them for the Paris Olympics. The boxer won the welterweight gold that year and has repeatedly been called “ridiculous” by Trump, who said in a speech in January Khelif was a “young gentleman who transitioned.”\n\n“I’m not transgender. I’m a woman,” Khelif said. “I want to live my life. Please do not exploit me in your political agendas.\n\n“What happened during the Olympics caused me psychological trauma, for me, and for my family. But I am still here. I am still fighting. I am still boxing.”\n\nWorld Athletics also introduced mandatory testing for female eligibility last summer, confirming that a test to detect the presence of the SRY gene would be enforced from September 1. The SRY gene is involved in male-typical sex development and is found in the Y chromosome.",
