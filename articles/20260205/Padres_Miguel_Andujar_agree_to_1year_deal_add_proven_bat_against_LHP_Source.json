  "content": "The San Diego Padres and free-agent corner infielder and outfielder Miguel Andujar have agreed to a one-year, $4 million deal, pending a physical, a league source confirmed to The Athletic on Wednesday.\n\nAndujar, a 30-year-old with proven ability against left-handed pitching, is set to become one of the more notable acquisitions of a quiet offseason in San Diego. The Padres had previously signed only one other position player, Korean infielder Sung-Mun Song, to a major-league contract.\n\nIn 94 games last season with the Athletics and Cincinnati Reds, Andujar hit .318 with 10 home runs and an .822 OPS, his most productive offensive campaign since he finished second in American League Rookie of the Year voting with the New York Yankees in 2018. Andujar logged a .986 OPS against lefties, raising his career mark versus southpaws to .807.\n\nAndujar makes for a logical fit on a Padres team that produced only a .690 OPS last season against lefties.\n\nHis defensive profile, meanwhile, could require some maneuvering. A below-average fielder, he split his appearances in 2025 somewhat equally between third base, left field and designated hitter. With San Diego, he could share time at first base with the left-handed-hitting Gavin Sheets while also cycling in at DH and occasionally spelling other corner defenders. (Andujar has made only seven career appearances, including four starts, at first base.)",
