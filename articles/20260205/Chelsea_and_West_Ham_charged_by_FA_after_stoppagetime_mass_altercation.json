  "content": "Chelsea and West Ham United have been charged by the Football Association following their mass altercation in the final stages of Saturday’s Premier League match at Stamford Bridge.\n\nIt is alleged Chelsea failed to prevent their players from behaving in an “improper and/or provocative way”, while West Ham allegedly failed to ensure their players did not behave in an “improper and/or provocative and/or violent way”.\n\nThe two clubs have until Friday, February 6 to provide a response.\n\nThe charges relate to an incident in the 95th minute, which was sparked by an initial clash between West Ham winger Adama Traore and Chelsea full-back Marc Cucurella on the touchline as they chased the ball into the corner. This resulted in Traore throwing Cucurella to the floor and Chelsea forward Joao Pedro responded by pushing Traore.\n\nWithin seconds, multiple players from both teams became involved. Following a VAR review, West Ham defender Jean-Clair Todibo was sent off for violent conduct after he grabbed Joao Pedro around the throat.\n\nJoao Pedro and Traore were both also shown yellow cards by referee Anthony Taylor.\n\nChelsea had trailed 2-0 at half-time during Saturday’s fixture following goals from Jarrod Bowen and Crysencio Summerville, but fought back in the second half to win the game 3-2, with Enzo Fernandez scoring a 92nd-minute winner. It marked the first time Chelsea had come from 2-0 down at half-time to win a Premier League fixture.\n\nThe result left West Ham 18th in the Premier League, six points from safety, while Chelsea are fifth.",
