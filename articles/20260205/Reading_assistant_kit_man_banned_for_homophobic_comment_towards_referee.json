  "content": "Reading’s assistant kit manager has been given a six-match ban after making a homophobic comment about a referee during a League One fixture.\n\nAn independent commission found Reading’s Richard Bone acted in an improper manner and/or used insulting and/or abusive words with a reference, either express or implied, to sexual orientation in a remark about referee Matt Corlett.\n\nThe Football Association (FA) confirmed Bone had been given a six-match stadium suspension, £200 ($271) fine and will complete a mandatory education programme.\n\nDuring the first half of August’s League One fixture between Reading and Huddersfield Town at the Select Car Leasing Stadium, Bone was heard commenting on Corlett: “He should be in the National League. He has sucked d*** to get to this level”.\n\nThe remark was overheard by fourth official Harrison Blair and later reported by both Blair and Reading’s head safety steward David Parker. Corlett was made aware of the comment at full time.\n\nThe assistant kit manager admitted to making the comment at full time and admitted to the FA charge on December 17. He expressed remorse for his remark, which was considered a “one-off incident” by the independent commission.\n\nThe commission deemed the offence fell towards the “lower end” of the sanctions guidelines and the minimum punishment of a six-game ban was considered appropriate. The suspension began on January 23, and the commission stated the ban reflected “the seriousness of the misconduct”.\n\nCorlett has taken charge of 11 League One and three League Two fixtures this season, and made his Championship debut in December.",
